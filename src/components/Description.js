        Working on web design projects has been my passion for more than one
        year. I started my journey as a graphic designer, and worked remotely on
        various digital projects. Iâ€™m always keen to learn new things and I like
        to keep in touch with the latest technology and digital trends, design
        and best practices.{" "}
